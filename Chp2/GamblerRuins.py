# 50/50 - seems like an unspecified loop with conditions because it keeps going
# randomly until it reaches goal or faials.
# Needs a cash tracker += 1 each time the 50/50

# time/average? Not sure how to calculate this yet.
# random? Not sure the algorithm that can do 50/50 like flipping a coin.

# Definitely need time for this. But somewhat I understand the problem. Just can't put them
# all together yet.
